I am learning about regex in Python and I have problems understanding the function groups().

>>> m = re.match("([abc])+", "abc")
Here I have defined the class [abc], which as I know, means any of the characters a to c. 
It's defined inside a group and the + sign means we want at least one of such groups. 
So I execute the following line and the result is understandable:

>>> m.group()
'abc'
>>> m.group(0)
'abc'
I get why this happens.
 The index of the main group is 0 and 'abc' matches the class we have defined. 
So far so good, but I don't get why the following lines get executed the way they do:
